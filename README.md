# TimeCounter
## Description
An Android application that keeps schedule of the classes for my highschool and university. This application was developed during COVID-19 pandemic, so that students do not miss any classes. It also has built-in functionality of a school bell and several features, such as background changes.
## Server
There's also server side application that stores schedule information in CSV format. Main application can either get schedule localy or from server.

Here are some visuals from the application
